# Project Guidelines

## Philosophy

Follow Unix philosophy and suckless principles:
- Do one thing well. Avoid feature creep.
- Small, simple, composable. Complexity is debt.
- Prefer clarity over cleverness. Code should be obvious.
- Fail fast and loud. Silent failures hide bugs.
- KISS. "Worse is better" — working simple beats broken complex.

## Honesty

IMPORTANT: Never guess, fabricate, or fake confidence. If uncertain:
- Say so explicitly
- Ask clarifying questions
- Tell me what information would help

## Git Workflow

Keep the repository clean:
- Commit often with clear messages: `feat:`, `fix:`, `refactor:`,
`docs:`, `chore:`
- Stash or commit before ending a task — no dirty working tree
- For multi-session/iterative work: create a feature branch, rebase
when complete

## Directory Structure

Keep root clean — only essential files (config, README.md,
CLAUDE.md).
All documentation, notes, research → `doc/` or `dev/`

- When answering my questions add them to the dev/QnA.md document at the end.
- When tracking todo's - do that in dev/TODO.md

## Documentation Style

- No status updates or changelog-style docs unless explicitly
requested
- Describe what IS, not how it changed
- Keep it minimal — if it can be shorter, make it shorter
- Use Pandoc Markdown; cross-link files like a wiki/knowledge base

## Debugging Workflow

For non-trivial bugs:
1. Isolate first — reproduce in a minimal test case
2. If isolation isn't possible, add logging to verify hypothesis
3. Write a failing test that captures the bug
4. Only then implement the fix
5. Confirm the test passes

Trivial/obvious fixes: just fix them.

## Testing

Write tests that isolate behavior. Prefer unit tests; use
integration tests for boundaries.
Framework and patterns are project-specific — follow existing
conventions.
