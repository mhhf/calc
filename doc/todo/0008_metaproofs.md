# Metaproofs

Prove properties about CALC programs: conservation, safety, termination.

- [ ] State property DSL (language to express invariants)
- [ ] Invariant checker (initial + preservation verification)
- [ ] Reachability queries ("can state S be reached?")
- [ ] Counter-example generation (trace to violating state)
