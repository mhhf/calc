# Reachability Queries

Extracted from TODO_0008. Given a state property, determine if any leaf of the symexec tree satisfies it.

- [ ] Property evaluation over symexec leaves
- [ ] Path extraction (trace from root to matching leaf)
- [ ] Bounded vs unbounded search

See: `doc/research/execution-trees-metaproofs.md`
