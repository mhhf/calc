# Multimodal Worked Examples

Extracted from TODO_0014. Concrete programs exercising the multimodal system.

- [ ] Token: `[Alice] (token 100)` — basic ownership
- [ ] Transfer: ownership change via bridge rule
- [ ] Atomic swap: two-party exchange with `WITH` clause
- [ ] AMM (automated market maker): liquidity pool with arithmetic
