# Forward Optimization Research

Stages 5-11 are done. Open research for future scaling. Subtasks exported:

- TODO_0022.Topic_1 — Forward chaining networks: see [TODO_0035](0035_forward-chaining-networks.md)
- TODO_0022.Topic_2 — Incremental matching: see [TODO_0036](0036_incremental-matching.md)
- TODO_0022.Topic_3 — Compiled pattern matching: see [TODO_0037](0037_compiled-pattern-matching.md)
- TODO_0022.Topic_4 — Stage 8: path-based nested access (depth 4+ terms, O(K×D) vs O(N)). Not yet needed — current EVM uses depth 1-2 terms.
