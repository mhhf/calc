# Expression Foundation

Only if TODO_0002 decides in favor of expression constructors.

- [ ] Expression type constructors (`calculus/ill/prelude/symbolic.ill`)
- [ ] Catch-all backward clauses (equational completion)
- [ ] Confluence proof for restricted Store.put normalization
- [ ] Store.put restricted normalization (ground folding)
- [ ] Import wiring (`evm.ill` -> `symbolic.ill`)
- [ ] Integration tests
