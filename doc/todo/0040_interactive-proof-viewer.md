# Interactive Proof Tree Viewer

Extracted from TODO_0025. Render proof trees embedded in markdown via a `proof` code block processor.

- [ ] Define proof tree format for code blocks (```{proof})
- [ ] Client-side hydration (expand/collapse nodes, highlight active sequent)
- [ ] Integration with existing proof tree data structures (pt.js)
