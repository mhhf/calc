# QCHR (Quantified CHR)

QCHR extends CHR with quantified rules:

- **Existential simpagation** (`∃`): there exists a value making the body succeed
- **Universal simpagation** (`∀`): all values must make the body succeed

The quantifiers are **dynamic binders** — generated at runtime, not statically (unlike QCSP). This enables modeling games with an unknown number of moves.

## Example

```
∀X. board(X) \ move(X) ⟺ valid(X) | played(X).
```

Universal: for ALL possible moves X, the rule must succeed.

## In CALC

CALC's symexec corresponds to QCHR solving where:
- All branching is universal (`∀` — explore everything)
- `⊕` = existential (system decides)
- Loli continuations = dynamic binder (rules produced at runtime)
- `pathVisited` = tabling/memoization
- ω_l^{∃∀} provides the proof framework for execution trees
